TODO:
	Extract GraphVisualisation as a class library/project. (To keep using the System.Numerics.Vectors.Vector3 class and avoid other unity-fication.)
	NodeWithMass
		Make this extention better using a pattern (forgot the name) (we might add more than only mass and might want to use a random subset of those).
	Node
		Make sure there is a cap to either the speed or the force (otherwise the nodes will get too close and then speed away from eachother too fast).
